# Oxygen_Supply_Management_System

This is our second year group project of Database Management System.
We had only done backend work for this project using MySQL. 

Motivation is:

- As we faced many oxygen requirement issues due to corona.
- Many corona patients died due to unavailability of oxygen. 
- So, with the help of this project we can able to calculate our daily oxygen requirement. Also, hospitals can able to order oxygen cylinders through many suppliers so that the needy patient get the oxygen supply in time. So, our motivation is this current pandemic covid situation.
